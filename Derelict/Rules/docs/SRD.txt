Line of Sight
-------------
Line of sight between two cells exists when every cell touched by the Bresenham line
algorithm between them is free of obstructions. A cell is obstructed if it is not a
corridor cell or contains a blocking token such as a closed door, marine, alien or
blip. When the line steps diagonally between two cells, at least one of the two
adjacent off-diagonal cells must also be unobstructed; otherwise line of sight is
blocked. The check is performed in both directions and line of sight exists only
if both paths are unobstructed.

Marine Field of View
--------------------
Marines can only see within a 90-degree arc centered on their facing direction.
Cells outside this field of view are never considered visible to the marine,
even if unobstructed.

Blip Movement Restriction
-------------------------
Blips may not move into any cell that has line of sight to a cell containing a
marine. This uses the marine's field of view and line-of-sight rules above.
Blips also cannot move into any of the eight cells directly adjacent to a
marine, regardless of visibility. The rules filter available blip movement
options to enforce these restrictions.
