# Derelict Game Rules Modules

This folder contains initially one but later perhaps more implementations of the Rules interface.

Rules implement various kinds of board game rules.  

Rules will read and write the BoardState object.  Rules will also reference two Players objects, and ask them to make choices.

Based on these choices made, the game will progress until one player wins.

Initially the rules of the game are very simple: 

* The first player controls the marines.  The second player for the time being does not do anything.
* The first player must select a cell on the board with a marine in it to activate the marine.  If there are no marines on the board that can be selected, the game is lost.
* Once a marine is seledcted, the controlling player may choose to move one cell forward (in the direction the marine is facing) assuming this cell is a corridor and does not contain either a marine or a blip, or turn left, or turn right, or select a different marine to activate it.
* This selection and movement can continue indefinitely.
