# Derelict Game Player Modules

This directory will contain the player modules for the derelict game.

There are two primary kinds of Player: Human controlled and computer controlled.

A human player is controlled by the user of the browser via the graphical user interface.

A computer player is controlled using simple heuristics. 

Both kinds of player effectively make choices among different options that are presented to them by the game rules.

Players, when asked to make a choice will return it as a Promise. 

This is necessary because human players need time to think and cannot act immediately, so the caller will need to wait on the Promise.

The human player will call the Game module which provides the game UI.  Typically, the human player will provide the Game with choices to highlight visually in the UI, like cells that are permissible to be selected, and the user has to click one of these cells to proceed.  

The computer player will just make a choice, in the simplest implementation basically by making a random choice.  We can add smarter heuristics later.
