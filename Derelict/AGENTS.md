- Before modifying code in this repository, review the top-level product requirements in `docs/PRD.txt`.
- When working within a submodule (`BoardState`, `Editor`, or `Renderer`), read the requirement documents in the submodule's `docs` directory to ensure changes stay aligned with those specifications.
  - `BoardState/docs/*.md`
  - `Editor/docs/*.md`
  - `Renderer/docs/*.md`

These documents define the expected behavior and design for each part of the project.
